          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>The Politico idea came from a need that we observed amongst our politicians and citizens who wished to try out a flexible platform with different electoral activities and openness, but faced either trust issues expressing themselves and giving their mandate or only a few options for politicians who want to run for office . With Politico, you can explore a wide variety of activities to find what you need and do it with ease.</p>
